I really had such a wonderful experience reading your poetry project. The way you structured the poem, balancing the text of the narrator with each url link, makes this page of text easily accessible and visually stimulating. Each break "< / br >" act as much like punctuation as a period or exclamation point. It was cool to read through it, go back and look at the image links, and then read through it again. The nonconventional composition of the work is also easier to make sense of and enjoy given the relatability of the subject matter, the weather. At this point of the year, everyone is just exhausted with the back and forth from freezing to hot, snow to rain, etc. Awesome, awesome job!
