For my non-linear narrative, I’ve decided on a story called “The Machine’s Journey”, which is a game that puts players in the shoes of a sentient machine, exploring what remains of the world after humans have long gone extinct. They’ll find how they were created and what went wrong with humanity. The player may encounter other robots that could help or harm their journey. The player will be able to choose if they accept help from these other robots and where they want to go.
