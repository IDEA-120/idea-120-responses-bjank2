While reading Salter’s excerpt about Gesamtkunstwerk, I began to understand the idea that certain pieces of art go beyond the piece itself. The idea of the spectator’s involvement in the art piece itself is something I never stopped to think about before but it does bring me back to reflect on experiences I’ve had with art where I now view the creator of the art and perceiving the art as a part of the artistic process entirely. To also see that the assembling of the ‘art’ is itself also a part of the art experience is something that I haven’t ever really thought about before but has opened my eyes to what it means and contributes to the piece itself. 

My first reaction to this was to compare all of the experiences I’ve had interacting with art going beyond the actual piece itself. I thought back to museums I’ve been to and reflected how my experience perceiving the art as the spectator contributed to the overall experience of the art piece itself, which put me back into the shoes of the artist where I imagine what their original perspective and purpose was for this piece versus how they expected the spectator to perceive it. Beyond this is the media we consume today, movies that are created to be perceived, games that are designed to be interacted with, and social media that we are meant to interject ourselves into based off of viewing others’ ‘art’.
