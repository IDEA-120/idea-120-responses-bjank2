An example of an image that would be ready differently depending on the medium is a photography of a model wearing a high end brand of clothing. If the model were seen in a magazine that would be one medium of media, but if the model were to post the picture on social media, that would be a different medium where it might be come across differently. The linguistic message for this would be in the ad, the brand name would be a significant message. The influencer could also post a hashtag promoting the brand in that case. The iconic message would be the colors and design of the clothes that are likely specific to that brand. The influencer might protray a certain mood or feeling with their photo than the ad. The cultural message would be that in the magazine the message would be focused on the brand and trying to sell a product, while an influencer's post might be about that, it might be focused more on trying to promote their own page but also the product as a secondary ad.
