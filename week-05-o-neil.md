An example of a weapon of “math destruction” as Cathy O’Neil describes in her book, could be an algorithm used to measure a teacher’s effectiveness with their students’ test scores and based on that alone with penalties. This would not be effective in measuring a teacher’s ability because there are a number of factors that go into how well a student does on a test and very well could have many outliers to potentially get them fired.
