The importance of immersion in film is incredibly important for the viewer to feel as if they are also a part of the production. 
But at the same time, realism has been lost on the actors' end when greenscreens are used and it loses authenticity for the actors to feel immersed. 
The sets of a show or a movie help the actors interact with their surroundings so it feels more authentic. 
The tech used in the Mandalorian to create a virtual background is something I've never heard of before but I think is especially cool. 
I believe those smaller details such as off-lighting or green-screen mishaps, can make or break how both the viewer and the actors interact with the set.
With the accessibility of film and shows increasing, being able to watch almost every movie or show on your phone/laptop, I feel like the importance of detail is especially emphasized because in my personal experience, being able to watch things on my own versus in a theater or on a tv for whatever reasons brings about looking more into the backdrop of the set and inspecting what's going on. 
I think it's just a way to further anaylze smaller details of the film, but if there's something small such as a hint or a nod to character that ties in the authenticity more, I think it makes it all the more fascinating. For whatever reason, I think of the Marvel Series Wandavision when I think about the set of a film impacting the overall feel of a show because of the attention to detail around Wanda to make it seem like her dream life with some blips in her world.
Overall, I think the combination of being able to immerse both the actors via virtual screens and the viewer via mobile devices/increasing accessibility to seeing films/shows, they both produce more personal experiences. The internet has brought upon a great deal of personal interaction that we can have with media that we consume, such as being able to easily watch things over, viewing media anywhere, being able to talk to other viewers in the moment (reminding me of The Last of Us commentary flooding social media after a new episode airs), and even the ability to potentially interact with the actors who were apart of the process of creating the piece of media.
