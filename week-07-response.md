Bridle is absolutely correct with his evidence that the internet is not a safe place for children to be roaming free right now, the way most do. I too grew up with an experience that I was accessing the internet everyday as I got older and definitely see that it had an effect on me, especially when there wasn’t a lot of knowledge about earlier content and that most of it wouldn’t be good for kids. I think there were some creators that I would talk about with my friends at school who were definitely not at all appropriate to be watching for our age but a lot of it was normalized unfortunately. There wasn’t a lot of regulation for myself and a lot of my friends and while I think there’s a new epidemic as Bridle states, of this content marketed towards children that is incredibly harmful and exploitive, I think some of it has been around for a long time just in different forms. When I was younger a lot of these creators would create content with bright, flashy colors and bold text to draw in your attention, some even drawing in kids with topics that might interest them when it turned out to be sexual or vulgar content. 

The difference between this new form of kids content and content that was technically marketed for “all ages”, is that it’s suddenly so much more profitable to make this content since children have iPads in their hands all day, most unattended, and just endlessly click all day. It makes it easy for algorithms to pump out content with these keywords and in turn, create disturbing content mixed in with the actual ill intentioned content made for kids. I agree that these media platforms do need to take responsibility, but I do think it would be very challenging. I think it would have to be at a level that television networks are at for kids’ shows. I believe now there is a YouTube kids but I’ve heard that it’s not entirely reliable either. I think for it to really work it would have to be approved at a video by video basis by a team of people. This wouldn’t even resolve the issue entirely of keeping children off the internet, I believe it also has to be a parental level to limit them and monitor their usage. They could have a YouTube kids app that’s entirely filtered through and still be searching for other content on different platforms.
