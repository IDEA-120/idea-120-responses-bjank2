I believe that the internet would be more egalitarian without these methods. Although I’m sure some of it is particularly useful in reaching target demographics for some of it’s content and is convenient, I’m sure overall the harm is much more extreme than the good. Relating to O’Neil’s example of targeted ads from for-profit universities, I feel like another example of this would be younger generations playing Call of Duty and in turn getting ads for joining the US military and being persuaded based off of this one interest that would not nearly reflect the real experience of being in the military. While it’s important to stop and evaluate the data you are perceiving, why you might be seeing this data or ad, and the corroborating it with other documents, not everyone has the information to evaluate the content they are seeing or understand that it can be misleading or target you with ill intent.
