Nakamura’s take of Manovich’s statement tells us that what we use as creatives are not neutral, but they are a reflective of the biases of their designers. This lead me to think of Instagram, where we see it for it’s users, not it’s design biases. Instagram’s design is centered around the idea of sharing and consuming images and videos, with features like filters and minor photo manipulation. The choice to make Instagram have these tools is a reflection of the design process of it’s creators, placing a high value on the aesthetics of the users’ posts and what they are presenting of theirselves.

Another instance of Instagram’s design intention are the algorithms in place to discover new content and will prioritize certain posts over others. This could be a reflection of what the designers of Instagram felt were valuable or engaging content. These are both examples of underlying biases that we don’t regularly consider when consuming content on social media apps. While some of these biases may seem unfair, a lot of it helps keep bad content (inappropriate, violent, or obscene content) because they have made the concious choice to involve their biases in what should be the face of what their app represents.
